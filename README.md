# NumberShortcuts

NumberShortcuts is a [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/) script which gives you:
- Shortcuts when you hold down the right mouse button and a number on your keyboard. 
- Toggle the script with the right mouse button + Esc

This is my first published script, so don't expect too much ;-)  

## Installation

NumberShortcuts is extremely easy to install: 
- Just download and extract the script
- Edit the settings file to suit your needs
- Run the script

You can autorun the script on windows startup by plasing it in the [Startup folder]( https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026268/windows-change-startup-apps-in-windows-10)



## Customization

Edit the settings file to suit your needs. Simply write the link or path you want to open on the specified number.
eks C:\Users\(User_Name)\Documents, D:\Programs\example.exe or https://www.github.com/

NB! When changes are made, you have to rerun the script
